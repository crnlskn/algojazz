1. **Introduction**  
    Music is math, or so they say! This is just yet-another attempt of mine, but this time with weird-ass post-kabbalistic homotopically coherent abstract nonsense. As in, with M_11 as `2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 11` we have 16ths notes, 6C3 chords and voicings, 5 octaves, and 11 notes in addition to the identity morphism. Hence `mod 7920` defines a music measure universe. 

2. **Philosophy**  
    The guiding principle is the holographic one, and also some vague mumbling about the god of the gap, the ineffible self, and Meg&Dia's Monster and the Monster group and quantum foam. Looks, if it grooves it grooves.

3. **Problem Statement**  
   Deriving a consistent functor that reliablly decomposes any `mode 7920` into an "interesting" measure while also allowing cyclical expansionn and resulting quantization drift and so on; as in, make the machine able to play wrong such that it can discover how to improvise, basically.

4. **Approach**  
   Iunno, probably "make shit up unntil it works"; that's the guiding principle behind epistemology after all.

5. **Impact**  
   Uhmm, hmm.. I'm gonna say "maybe" here I think.

6. **Comparison**  
7. **Future Vision**  
8. **Acknowledgments**  
So many, you know them better than me!!
